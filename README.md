## Installation

1. ### Create your API Key on the openAI website: [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
<img src="img/key.jpg" alt="img">

- To store your api key, you have <strong>2 options</strong>

  1.  Using a key on the frontend: You can put your API Key in a json file, without the need to use a server.<br>

  - The advantage is that you don't need a server.<br>
  - The disadvantage is that your API KEY is exposed, and other people can see it.<br>
    Then access the file.json file (html-files/json/config.json) and put your key in the <strong>API_KEY</strong> field between the quotes

  2.  Using a key on the backend: The second option, you can use a php file to store your key, so your key will be protected on the server<br>
      To use this option, you must set the "use_php_api" field to <strong> true</strong> in the config.json file.<br>
      <strong>Note: To use this option you will need a host with PHP 7 or higher</strong><br>

  <br>

  After modifying the config.json file, also modify the php file with your key<br>

2.  ### Configure your environment

    The CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security measure that browsers implement to protect users against malicious attacks that can occur when a website attempts to access resources from another site. In other words, CORS is a security policy that browsers use to prevent a site from accessing information from another site without authorization.
    <br>
    When you try to run the index.html file locally and it makes a request to another file such as config.json, the browser may prevent the request from being completed due to the CORS security policy. This is because the browser is trying to protect you against possible malicious attacks.
    <br>
    To solve this problem, it is recommended to run the application on a local server on your machine such as WAMP, XAMPP or similar. Alternatively, you can upload the application to your website using FTP.

    <strong>After configuring your environment, you can access `index.html` in your browser and test</strong>

3.  ### Customizing the project images

    The chatbots images are in the thumb folder, in SVG format, you can add images in the format you want, I recommend images with a height of less than 600px, and png or svg.

4.  ### Customizing the characters

    You can configure the behavior of the characters by opening the config.json file
    <br>

    - <strong>name:</strong> Name of the character that will appear in the chat
    - <strong>image:</strong> Character image path
    - <strong>description:</strong> Description of the character that appears in the carousel
    - <strong>welcome_message:</strong> Initial message that the character will send when opening the chat
    - <strong>display_welcome_message:</strong> Configures whether the initial message will appear in the chat
    - <strong>expert:</strong> Label that says what the character is expert at
    - <strong>background_thumb_color:</strong> Character thumbnail background color
    - <strong>training:</strong> Says what the character will be like, how he will behave, what tone he will use in his answer, write everything here in first person

    <br>

### To add a new character:

   <br>
    add a comma in the penultimate json node, and just copy and paste a new node of json characters, and write their names and instructions.

## Badwords

In the config.json file you can define if you want to use a filter for badwords.<br>
This filter is great if you want to prevent the user from typing certain words in the chat.
<br>

(In config.json: "filter_badwords": true)
<br>
You can change list of badwords in json/badwords.json file.
